Introduction
-------------
Linux target framework (tgt) aims to simplify various SCSI target
driver (iSCSI, Fibre Channel, SRP, etc) creation and maintenance.

Currently, tgt supports the following target drivers:

- iSCSI software target driver for Ethernet NICs

- iSER software target driver for Infiniband and RDMA NICs

tgt can emulate the following device types:

- SBC: a virtual disk drive that can use a file to store the content.

- SMC: a virtual media jukebox that can be controlled by the "mtx"
tool.

- MMC: a virtual DVD drive that can read DVD-ROM iso files and create
burnable DVD+R. It can be combined with SMC to provide a fully
operational DVD jukebox.

- SSC: a virtual tape device (aka VTL) that can use a file to store
the content.

- OSD: a virtual object-based storage device that can use a file to
store the content (in progress).

The code is under the GNU General Public License version 2.


Developer Notes
-------------
The central resource for tgt development is the mailing list
(stgt@vger.kernel.org).

First, please read the following documents (in short, follow Linux
kernel development rules):

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches

Then, check your patches with the patch style checker prior to
submission (scripts/checkpatch.pl) like the following example.

fujita@arbre:~/git/tgt$ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl ~/0001-add-bidi-support.patch
Your patch has no obvious style problems and is ready for submission.
